## Sublimation

Sublimation has a wide color gamut, is great for **bold and bright prints**, has **zero hand feel, and never cracks, peels, or fades**.

Sublimation inks are printed from an inkjet head onto a roll of transfer paper. The paper is then placed on top of the fabric while heat and pressure are applied. The ink turns into a gas and dyes to the fibers permanently.

We use sublimation for all of our polyester and rPET fabrics.

## Reactive Inkjet

**Colors come out bright and bold**. The fabric also has **zero hand feel**, and because of the dyed nature, **it never cracks, peels, or fades** with excellent wash fastness.

Reactive inkjet uses the same dye that makes your black t-shirt black, in a highly refined form. This dye solution is printed through an inkjet head directly to the pre-treated surface of the cotton fabric and the cotton fabric is dyed by exposing the printed fabric to steam.

We use reactive inkjet printing for all of our cotton/cellulose-based fabrics.
