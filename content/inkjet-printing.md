## Reactive Inkjet

**Colors come out bright and bold**. The fabric also has **zero hand feel**, and because of the dyed nature, **it never cracks, peels, or fades** with excellent wash fastness.

Reactive inkjet uses the same dye that makes your black t-shirt black, in a highly refined form. This dye solution is printed through an inkjet head directly to the pre-treated surface of the cotton fabric and the cotton fabric is dyed by exposing the printed fabric to steam, and then the excess dye is washed out during the garment washing cycle. Finally the fabric is stentered to avoid any distortion and to heat set the fabric.

This is the **most premium (and difficult) printing process** for natural fibers like cotton or rayon.

We use reactive inkjet printing for all of our cotton/cellulose-based fabrics.

## Sublimation

Sublimation has a wide color gamut, is great **for bold and bright prints,** has **zero hand feel, and never cracks, peels, or fades.**

![sublimation image](./img/inkjet-printing-sublimation.jpg)

Sublimation inks are printed from an inkjet head onto a roll of transfer paper. The paper is then placed on top of the fabric while heat and pressure are applied. The ink turns into a gas and dyes to the fibers permanently. 

We use sublimation for all of our polyester and rPET fabrics.
