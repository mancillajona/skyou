### Tired of decorating premade blanks, in a defined 10 x 10 print area?

### Want to deliver true retail quality to your customers?

### Want to display your brand, and not Hanes or Bella?

**SKYOU is manufacturing on demand, NOT printing on demand.** Most POD vendors are printing onto a pre-made blank, whether it’s a tote bag, t-shirt, or hoodie.  These vendors buy a low quality blank, and then decorate it with a pigment based ink.  These inks wash poorly, have a plastic hand (on darks), and have a limited color gamut.

Every SKYOU product is printed to a white roll of fabric using dyes, laser cut, and then sewn together.  This means, you can decorate every part of the fabric, with as mild or wild of a graphic as you like.  You aren’t limited by the available colors of a Hanes shirt, because we PRINT the color of the shirt you specify.  Bespoke manufacturing for bespoke brands.  This allows us to make amazing retail quality products that represent your brand the way you want.
