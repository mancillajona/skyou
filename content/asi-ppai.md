# ASI/PPAI

SKYOU is a registered ASI/PPAI supplier.  We specialize in all over print soft goods, specifically bags and garments.

If you’ve dealt with a Chinese factory before the experience was likely less than ideal.  We’re a bit different as we 
1. Own our factories, we are not a trading company 
2. Are American owned and operated 
3. Have excellent english communication
