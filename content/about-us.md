### Our Story

Prior to founding SKYOU we started the first web-based mass customization company, Timbuk2 Designs, in San Francisco. After selling Timbuk2 to private equity, we started a consulting business teaching global brands how to mass customize their products. We set up factories and built software for NikeID, Reebok, Adidas, Keds, Timberland and many others, to allow them to make one-off apparel, footwear and bags.

Using our expertise in one-off manufacturing, we envisioned bringing retail quality products to any artist, designer, influencer or brand, regardless of size. That's why we started SKYOU.

SKYOU is a web-based product platform focused on low/no minimum order quantity retail-quality products.  We bridge the gap between factories and brands with our innovative 3D design tool.  We own our own factories in Guangzhou China and Tijuana, Mexico focused on no-moq manufacturing.  We eliminate the need for minimums with a mastery of digital printing, laser cutting, short run sewing and direct drop-shipping.  We innovate printing technologies that allow us to print on cotton (and any cellulose fiber), synthetics, and nearly any substrate with digital printing that removes expensive set up charges or minimum runs.

We have a large selection of standard apparel and accessories patterns, including custom-made T-shirts, hoodies, face masks, backpacks, totes, etc. We offer all-over printing and custom manufacturing to meet your specific brand requirements. We can also source custom products not in our standard product list.
