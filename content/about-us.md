# About Us

SKYOU is a web-based product platform focused on low/no minimum order quantity retail-quality products.

We bridge the gap between factories and brands with our innovative 3D design tool. We own our own factories in Guangzhou China and Tijuana, Mexico focused on no-moq manufacturing.

We eliminate the need for minimums with a mastery of **digital printing, laser cutting, short run sewing and direct drop-shipping**. We innovate printing technologies that allow us to print on cotton (and any cellulose fiber), synthetics, and nearly any substrate with digital printing that **removes expensive set up charges or minimum runs**.

## Our Story

Prior to founding SKYOU we started the first web-based mass customization company, Timbuk2 Designs, in San Francisco. After selling Timbuk2 to private equity, we started a consulting business teaching global brands how to mass customize their products. We set up factories and built software for NikeID, Reebok, Adidas, Keds, Timberland and many others, to allow them to make one-off apparel, footwear and bags.
